    Use WPT version of test harness for HTML core test conversion (#1859)
    
    When converting tests to HTML for use in WPT, use the path to
    the test harness in WPT's resources/ directory. This is also
    important because the WPT test runner users this path inclusion
    to discover the tests.
    
    There are several more things I want to simplify here but I'm
    starting with just this because it matches the sed transform
    that @past originally wrote in
    https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/49277
